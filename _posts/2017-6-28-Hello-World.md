title: New York City MTA Subway Traffic

For our first project at Metis Data Science Bootcamp, we used MTA subway traffic data to analyze ridership volumes across stations in the subway system.

A fictitious company (WTWY Inc. - Women Tech Women Yes) approached our team with a problem they needed help solving. WTWY's mission was to increase the participation of Women in the Tech industry and STEM subjects and was hosting a fundraising gala early in the summer. 

WTWY wanted to advertise the event and increase awareness of its mission across individuals who were enthusiastic and passionate about its mission. To this end, WTWY wanted to optimize the location of their canvassing team across the subway stations during its marketing campaign.

Our deadline to analyze the data and make a recommendation was a few days away, and after a conversation with WTWY we determined the following information which helped guide our analysis:

1. The gala was to occur the first week of June.
2. The canvassing team was comprised of three groups.
3. Canvassing groups were mobile and could change locations during the day.
4. Canvassing would occur for one week in the spring.
5. WTWY's marketing team determined the target demographic to be individuals already in Tech and in particular: Women already in Tech.
